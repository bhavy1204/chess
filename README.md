# Chess Game ♟️

A simple chess game built using **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
No frameworks, no libraries — just pure front-end magic.

## 🚧 Status
Currently **under development**. New features and improvements are being added frequently.

## 🎯 Features (WIP)
- Interactive chessboard  
- Basic piece movement  
- Move validation (in progress)  
- Check / Checkmate logic (upcoming)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for game logic

## 🚀 Setup
Just clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser.  
That's it. No build steps, no configs.

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

## 📌 Notes

This project is a playground for exploring chess logic and DOM manipulation from scratch.
